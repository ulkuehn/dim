              Deus In Machina (DIM) is a writing tool intended for small, medium
              and large projects such as novels, short stories, and non-fiction.
            </p>
            <p>
              While offering editing and formatting tools well known from other
              text editors DIM features powerful methods to add a semantic level
              to your project. It is as much a world building and research tool
              as it is a writing tool.
            </p>
            <p>
              The real magic happens when you connect both levels, syntactic
              (text) and semantic (world). You can tag any text passage with any
              world item (called object), resulting in a list of quotes that are
              connected to that item. When you edit one of these text passages
              the respective quote is updated automatically. In the text editor
              you can easily inspect what objects are connected to a text. Just
              activate the objects you are interested in and they get
              highlighted by their fully customizable individual style.

                    <h3>What is DIM? Should I use it?</h3>
                    <p>
                      If you ever write more than a shopping list, definitely!
                      DIM is a writing tool intended for small, medium and large
                      writing projects. While it features some well known
                      standards that come with many word processors, DIM has
                      some outstanding qualities:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        It adds a semantic level to texts with tools to build a
                        world of feature rich objects (characters, items,
                        locations, or anything else you might come up with)
                        texts can be connected with.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        It helps to manage large and complex texts and creative
                        projects by splitting them up into chunks (say, chapters
                        or scenes or sections) that can be edited individually
                        or in combination with other text chunks. Those chunks
                        can be moved around quickly to reorganize the overall
                        text.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Contrary to the concept of WYSIWYG (What you see is what
                        you get) with DIM you get what you want. Only when
                        finally putting everything together in exporting your
                        project for use by a more traditional word processor or
                        publishing software you decide what parts are included
                        and what parts are left out. There is no need to
                        consider what the output will finally be early in
                        writing. You can concentrate on content, not worry about
                        form.
                      </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                      Instructions for installing and building on Windows and
                      Linux are available on

                    <h3>Is there a Mac version?</h3>
                    <p>
                      Not for the time being as I don't have access to a Mac
                      based system.

                    <h3>Is it safe to use?</h3>
                    <p>
                      While DIM most certainly won't set your computer ablaze it
                      still is in an early development phase. There might be
                      errors not yet discovered. So, please save your work
                      frequently and help improving DIM by your feedback.

                    <h3>Is there a user's manual?</h3>
                    <p>
                      No. For now, the only guidance is this FAQ, some inline
                      help and a couple of sample projects.
                    </p>
                    <h3>What does "DIM" stand for?</h3>
                    <p>
                      It's short for <em>Deus In Machina</em>, Latin for "God in
                      the machine". This term is a pun to the infamous plot
                      device <em>Deus Ex Machina</em> that was common in ancient
                      Greek theater but should be avoided in modern fiction.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Currently, English and German are supported. What language
                      is used depends on your system defaults, but you can
                      change it in the settings.

                        its number of characters, words and objects is shown in
                        the status bar at the bottom of the editor.

                        Use the spellcheck button in the status bar of the
                        editor. All words considered wrongly spelled are marked
                        with a red wavy line (as per default; you can change
                        this in the settings).

                      You can change this by using
                      <em>Editor &rarr; Language</em>. The language used for
                      spell checking is independent of the language of the user
                      interface. There is no automatic recognition of the
                      language of the texts in the editor.

                      the list. The list is saved as part of the project, so
                      each project has its own list.

                    <p>
                      Text collections are sets of texts that are grouped
                      together. The texts in a collection come in a flat list no
                      matter what their level in the text tree is. They are
                      ordered along the tree sequence, though.<br />
                      There are two collection types:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        In user defined collections you can add whatever texts
                        you wish (e.g. you could make a collection of all
                        chapter headings or a collection of all texts having a
                        common viewpoint).
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        In search collections the set of texts is determined by
                        the search and filter criteria of the collection. Texts
                        are added or removed automatically when text contents or
                        properties change.

                    <p>
                      Objects represent arbitrary items (characters, places,
                      buildings, devices, animals, weapons, ideas, and anything
                      else you could think of). They are called "objects", but
                      don't take that term too narrow. Objects span dead as well
                      as living matter and even ideas.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Objects can be connected to those sections of a text that
                      are relevant for the object, thus adding a semantical
                      level to the text. If, for example, an object represents a
                      story's main character the sentences or paragraphs giving
                      a physical description of that character could be
                      connected to the object.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Once the relationship between objects and texts is
                      established it is easy to overview the relevant text
                      sections and to highlight them in the editor if needed.

                      Just move the respective tree item to the desired position
                      in the tree and drop it there. To move a whole branch,
                      keep the Shift key pressed.

                      and move the item to a new position in the tree. A copy of
                      the object will be placed there.

                    <p>
                      While the object copy inherits the properties of the
                      original object as far as possible, the new object is not
                      connected to any text.

                    <h3>How do I change an object's format?</h3>
                    <p>
                      The format of an object affects the styling of text
                      passages that are connected to the object, highlighting
                      those passages when an object is activated. You can set
                      the format in the <em>Style</em> tab of an object property
                      window.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Formats are inherited along the object hierarchy. If you
                      do not set any format controls for an object it has the
                      same style as its parent. All format settings for an
                      object is affecting its children unless you are overruling
                      them in any of the children individually.

                    <h3>What's behind schemes and properties?</h3>
                    <p>
                      Properties allow you to add content to objects. While it
                      may be sufficient to have an object just with a name in
                      certain cases, you may want to add more detail in others.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Schemes define what properties an object has. The content
                      is in the properties themselves. While it may seem
                      overengineered to have this scheme/property split it helps
                      when you have more than one object of a kind.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Consider three or more characters you want to keep track
                      of in your story. They all share the properties of name,
                      height, weight, eye color, character description,
                      birthday, and so on. Instead of adding these properties
                      repeatedly to several objects, create one parent object
                      (maybe called "character"), define its scheme to include
                      all necessary properties, which will then be available in
                      all objects placed one (or any) level down the tree
                      hierarchy.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Why can I edit some scheme entries but not others?</h3>
                    <p>
                      Object Schemes are inherited from parent objects, that's
                      why. The scheme defined in a parent (or grandparent)
                      object is part of the object's scheme and cannot be
                      changed. The idea is that you use the hierarchy of objects
                      to have more detail the further down an object is in the
                      tree levels.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      You could for example create an object "Building" with
                      properties "Color", "Year of construction" and "Design".
                      As its children consider one object "The Muzak Concert
                      Hall" with additional property "Seats" and another object
                      "Schlong Tower" with additional properties "Stories" and
                      "Rooftop Terrace?". Of course both, highrises and concert
                      halls have a year of construction, but seats are only
                      relevant for one of them.
                    </p>
                    <h3>What property types are there?</h3>
                    <p>
                      Overall, there are 13 types of properties you can choose
                      from in the <em>Scheme</em> tab:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        <p>Header</p>
                        <p>
                          Headers are just for organizing properties into
                          groups. You can give them a name -- and that's it.
                        </p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p>Relation</p>
                        <p>
                          Using a relation you can connect the object with any
                          other object. Describe the meaning of the relation in
                          its name, e.g. "mother of" or "living in". You can
                          specify a reverse relation (e.g. "son of" or
                          "inhabitant of") which can be seen in the related
                          object's overwiew tab and in a project's export.
                        </p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p>Checkbox</p>
                        <p>
                          With a checkbox you can provide a two valued property
                          that can be set on or off. An example would be a
                          property called "alive".
                        </p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p>Slider</p>
                        <p>
                          Sliders add a numerical range to an object. You
                          specify a minimum and a maximum value as well as a
                          step distance. The unit spec adds context. For
                          example, use a slider for a person's age ranging from
                          0 to 125 (should suffice for all humans) with step 1
                          and unit "years".
                        </p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p>Select dropdown</p>
                        <p>
                          Provides a dropdown box where you can pick one value
                          out of many. The values you can choose from are
                          defined by a string seperated by "#" characters. You
                          could define a property called "vehicle" using the
                          string "bicycle#car#supersonic golfcart".
                        </p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p>Radio</p>
                        <p>Much like a select, but all values are visible.</p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p>Color</p>
                        <p>A color box adds color information to an object.</p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p>Text line</p>
                        <p>
                          You can type a short unformatted text into a text
                          line, such as a person's name.
                        </p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p>Text editor</p>
                        <p>
                          In a text editor you can enter fully formatted longer
                          texts, including images. Use the editor directly in
                          the properties tab or open a detached window if you
                          need more screen space.

                      <li>
                        <p>Calender date</p>
                        <p>
                          Adds a control to the properties where you can pick a
                          single date. Provide a year range you can choose out
                          of if you need more or less than the one hundred years
                          in the past and in the future of today.

                        <p>You can set a date range with this control.</p>

                        <p>Geographical map</p>
                        <p>
                          The map scheme type allows you to add geographical
                          information of some place on earth to your object. You
                          can zoom to the area of your interest and add
                          locations as needed. Internet access is needed for the
                          maps to display.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Add locations to the map by right clicking on it. Give
                          them a description and a color and move them around on
                          the map as needed. To delete a location right click on
                          it.

                        <p>
                          With the file control you can add arbitrary files to
                          your object. When you pick a file from one of your
                          system folders a copy will become part of your
                          project. Its content is available in the object no
                          matter if the original file is still on your sytem or
                          if it was taken from some other computer where the
                          project was edited earlier.

                        <p>
                          A file is opened with the system's native application
                          for the respective file type (say, a video player).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Please be aware that files can blow up the size of
                          your project files considerably, so use them with
                          care.

                    <p>
                      <strong>Attention</strong>: when you change an item's type
                      in the scheme tab the content of the respective property
                      will be deleted. If you change the type by accident and
                      don't want to lose the original content, abort editing the
                      object. As long as you do not save the object nothing is
                      lost.

                    <h3>Can I define property types of my own?</h3>
                    <p>
                      No, the list is not user extensible. But you can use as
                      many of the provided types in an object as you wish.

                      (quotes) in all texts currently in the editor that are
                      connected with all currently activated objects. It thus
                      gives an overview of the objects you are interested in in

                      status set (concerning the maturity or progress of a
                      text), a text type set and a user defined set.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Each text can be assigned one of the values of each
                      category with icons showing these values in the text tree.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Initially the project categories are a copy of the global
                      categories as defined in the settings. You can adjust them
                      to the project's specifics.

                    <p>
                      Enter a password in the project properties window (tab
                      <em>Project information</em>). After that the project will
                      be saved encrypted and once closed can only be opened if
                      the password is provided.
                      <em
                        >Be aware that the project cannot be opened if you don't
                        remember the password. There is no known way to recover

                      Absolutely. Project files are, in essence, SQLite files
                      that can be handeled by tools like

                        >DB Browser for SQLite</a

                      with SQLCipher support.

                      HTML files and RTF files are supported. The textual
                      content of the file will be imported to one DIM text.

                      <em>File &rarr; Import &rarr; from folder</em>. All Text,
                      HTML and RTF files in that folder will be imported as
                      individual DIM texts. All other files are ignored. In the
                      settings you can control if the folder structure is

                      list.

                      browser like window. Load the web page by entering its URL
                      or following a link in an already opened page. As soon as
                      the page has fully loaded (might take a while) press the
                      <em>Import</em>-Button.

                    <p>
                      Depending on the website the import might be more or less
                      of what you could see and read in the browser.

                    <p>
                      If you want to import just parts of a web page, you can

                    <h3>What's the concept of exporting in DIM?</h3>
                    <p>
                      One of the ideas of DIM is that you should concentrate on
                      content, not appearance. It is hard enough to write good
                      texts and keep track of all aspects of the elements you
                      are writing about. How this may finally look on a sheet of
                      paper or in a publication should be the least of your
                      worries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Thus, only when exporting you decide what becomes part of
                      your product -- which texts, which objects and what
                      metadata. Don't expect fancy formatting such as page
                      numbers or footnotes. Your standard word processor or
                      desktop publishing program is a good place to feed the
                      export into to give it the final polish.
                    </p>
                    <h3>What information can be exported?</h3>
                    <p>
                      Almost always you'll want to export your texts, but you
                      can do more:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Project metadata like title, author, character or word
                        count
                      </li>
                      <li>Text metadata like name, status or word count</li>
                      <li>Text content, possibly enhanced with object tags</li>
                      <li>Object content and metadata</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>How do I determine what's in an export?</h3>
                    <p>
                      The export includes what you put in the editors. You can
                      enter and style regular text. It will be included in the
                      export as is. To insert some project specific information
                      use one of the placeholders from the select box top right
                      of the editor. Be aware that the cursor must be placed in
                      the editor before placeholders can be inserted.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      To tailor an export profile use the various editors and
                      options that are provided in the different tabs of the
                      export window:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        <p><em>Document</em> tab</p>
                        <p>
                          In this tab you set the format type and edit what the
                          export includes on a project level. In most cases you
                          need the <em>exported Texts</em> placeholder which is
                          a placeholder for the sequence of all texts as defined
                          in the <em>Texts</em> tab.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          If you want to add object information to your export,
                          also put the <em>exported Objects</em> placeholder
                          somewhere in the document editor.
                        </p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p><em>Texts</em> tab</p>
                        <p>
                          In this tab you select if all texts should be included
                          in the export or only the activated ones. To export
                          the text content, add the
                          <em>Text Content</em> placeholder. Use additional
                          placeholders for meta data.
                        </p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p><em>Object markings</em> tab</p>
                        <p>
                          When exporting texts you can highlight the embedded
                          objects if you wish. For one you can use the object
                          styling in yout texts, much the same as it appears in
                          the editor (with some limitations in RTF export).
                          Additionally, you can enclose each text passage
                          connected to an object with some extra text. You could
                          prepend the object's name, for example and enclose the
                          passage in parantheses.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Choose what objects you want to highlight -- all
                          objects, the activated objects or none at all. In the
                          latter case the other settings in that tab have no
                          effect.
                        </p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p><em>Objects</em> tab</p>
                        <p>
                          You can add a list of objects in your project if you
                          include the <em>exported Objects</em> placeholder in
                          the editor of the document tab. In this tab you set
                          what objects to include and what is included in the
                          object list for each object.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          You can choose between list style and table style for
                          object content and text quotes. If you use the
                          <em>Object content as list</em> placeholder you must
                          populate the <em>Object properties</em> tab.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          This tab is only needed if you include the
                          <em>Object content as list</em> placeholder in the
                          <em>Objects</em> tab. For each property of each object
                          this list is filled with what you set in the editor of
                          this tab.

                    <p>
                      No, not with the export function. But you can print the
                      editor's content to a PDF file. Or, first export to RTF or
                      HTML and go to PDF from there using your browser or word
                      processor.

                      You can print what's visible in the editor. More details

                    What is the difference between global and project settings?
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    Global settings are default settings that initially apply to
                    all new projects. They are stored in a central place on your
                    computer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Project settings are specific to individual projects,
                    overruling the respective global settings. They are stored
                    within project files.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As long as you do not touch a specific project setting the
                    respective global value will be effective in the project.
                    Typically, project settings are used sparsely as you want to
                    tailor the global settings to your best fit in the first
                    place. But of course you can do it any other way.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Why are there so many individual settings?</h3>
                  <p>
                    DIM is designed to give the user a maximum of flexibility
                    for organizing his or her writing process. While certain
                    features and design options may be welcome by some they
                    could be useless or even annoying for others.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It may take a while to find the best setup individually but
                    in the end you will hopefully find yourself at home in DIM.
                  </p>
                  <h3>What are Standard categories?</h3>
                  <p>
                    Standard categories are default text categories (such as
                    text status) that are used initially in all new projects.
                    They can be adapted to the project specific needs in the
                    project properties window (menu item
                    <em>File &rarr; Project properties</em>).
                  </p>
                  <h3>Can I reuse the settings of some other project?</h3>
                  <p>
                    Yes, this is possible by importing the project. See the
                    <em>Imports</em> section.
